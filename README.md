This web scraping program is designed to pull the DOM of https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/computers/tablets.
Buttons on the Form1.cs will allow users to chose what information to display from the recieved DOM.
Dom can also be sent to the Database file included in the folders (Note, anyone wanting to test this will need to correct the path to the database file).
Grid on the right of the application will allow users to query the database to view detailed information.
